- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

If components need more functionality, like keeping state, I would use classes. Functional components can be used when I do not need to use React state.

ComponentDidMount- set a components start post render.
ShouldComponentUpdate- staop a component from calling render if necessary.
ComponentWillUnmount- called before the component is unmounted and destroyed.

So that we can extract component logic into reuseable functions.
